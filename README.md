### Overview

`samplingsimulatorpy` is a Python package intended to assist those teaching or learning basic statistical inference.

This package allows users to generate virtual populations which can be sampled from in order to compare and contrast sample vs sampling distributions for different sample sizes.  The package also allows users to sample from the generated virtual population (or any other population), plot the distributions, and view summaries for the parameters of interest.


### Function Descriptions

- `generate_virtual_pop` creates a virtual population.
    - **Inputs** : distribution function (i.e. `np.random.lognormal`, `np.random.binomial`, etc), the paramaters required by the distribution function, and the size of the population.
    - **Outputs**: the virtual population as a tibble
- `draw_samples` generates samples of different sizes
    - **Inputs** : population to sample from, the sample size, and the number of samples
    - **Outputs**: returns a tibble with the sample number in one column and value in a second column.
- `plot_sample_hist` creates sample distributions for different sample sizes.
    - **Inputs** : population to sample from, the samples to plot, and a vector of the sample sizes
    - **Outputs**: returns a grid of sample distribution plots
- `plot_sampling_dist` creates sampling distributions for different sample sizes.
    - **Inputs** : population to sample from, the samples to plot, and a vector of the sample sizes
    - **Outputs**: returns a grid of sampling distribution plots
- `stat_summary`: returns a summary of the statistical parameters of interest
    - **Inputs**: population, samples, parameter(s) of interest
    - **Outputs**: summary tibble


#### How these fit into the Python ecosystem?

To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no existing Python package with the specific functionality to create virtual populations and make the specific sample and sampling distributions described above. We do make use of many existing Python packages and expand on them to make very specific functions. These include:
 - `scipy.stats` to get distribution functions
 - `np.random` to generate random samples
 - [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) to create plots

 Python `pandas` already includes some summary statistics functions such as `.describe()`, however our package will be more customizable.  Our summary will only include the statistical parameters of interest and will provide a comparison between the sample, sampling, and true population parameters.
